The repository is for the study of the effectiveness of a GNN used to predict the safety of street intersections. 
This could then be extended to predict the safety of streets themselves. These are examples of node and edge 
regression tasks as we will be giving each a continuous safety score. This could then be overlayed with a real map
and could inform people on the safest routes to take. Using these scores, we could then study the safest roads
and intersections and see what features make them the safest. At first the study will be limited to a small
region in California but could be generalized to any place where the original features could be recreated.
